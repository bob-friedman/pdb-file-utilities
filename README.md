# pdb-file-utilities
Python code to help process files of 3d protein structure (PDB format).

This initial set of files are samples of code used to process files for a research project. They are released as examples of access to the biopython and other modules.

## `pairwise-compare-files.py`

**Purpose:** This script iterates through a specified directory and prints all unique pairs of files found within that directory. This is useful for tasks that require comparing each file in a set against every other file.

**Usage:**
1.  **Set the directory:** Before running the script, you must modify the `directory` variable within the script to point to the target directory containing the files you want to process.
    ```python
    directory = "/path/to/your/files"  # Change this to your directory
    ```
2.  **Run the script:** Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python pairwise-compare-files.py
    ```

**Output Format & Adaptability:**
The script prints pairs of file paths, one pair per line, separated by a space. This output format is intentionally simple and can be easily adapted for use in shell scripts or other automation workflows. For example, you could redirect the output to a file and then use it to generate commands for running comparative analyses like TMscore:

Example output line:
`/path/to/your/files/file1.pdb /path/to/your/files/file2.pdb`

This could be used in a shell script like so:
```bash
# Assuming the output of pairwise-compare-files.py is saved in pairs.txt
while read file1 file2; do
  echo "Comparing $file1 and $file2"
  TMscore "$file1" "$file2" >> results.txt
done < pairs.txt
```

**Note:** The script currently prints absolute paths to the files. You might need to adjust this behavior depending on your specific use case.

## `pdb-model-chain.py`

**Purpose:** This script prints model and protein chain information from PDB (`.pdb`) files. It iterates through PDB files in the current directory, extracting and displaying details about the models and chains within each file.

**Usage:**
1.  **Navigate to the directory:** Open your terminal and change to the directory containing the `.pdb` files you wish to analyze.
2.  **Run the script:** Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python pdb-model-chain.py
    ```
    The script will automatically process all `.pdb` files found in the current working directory.

**Dependencies:**
*   **BioPython:** This script requires the BioPython library to parse PDB files. You can install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install biopython
    ```

## `pdb-residue-index-reset.py`

**Purpose:** This script resets the residue numbering in PDB (`.pdb`) files to start from 1 for each chain. This is particularly useful for standardizing PDB files or preparing them for further analysis where consistent residue indexing is required.

**Usage:**
1.  **Set the directory:** Before running the script, you must modify the `directory` variable within the script to point to the target directory containing the `.pdb` files you want to process.
    ```python
    directory = "/path/to/your/pdb_files"  # Change this to your directory
    ```
2.  **Run the script:** Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python pdb-residue-index-reset.py
    ```
    The script will process all `.pdb` files in the specified directory and overwrite the original files with the residue numbering reset.

**Dependencies:**
*   **BioPython:** This script requires the BioPython library to parse and manipulate PDB files. You can install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install biopython
    ```

**Note:** This script is primarily intended for use with PDB files that have been split into individual chain files, for example, those generated by the `pdb-split-files.py` script. Applying it to multi-chain PDB files might lead to residue numbers being reset for each chain within that single file, which may or may not be the desired outcome.

## `pdb-split-files.py`

**Purpose:** This script splits PDB (`.pdb`) files into multiple smaller PDB files. Each of the generated files contains a subsequence of 9 amino acid residues from the original PDB file.

**Usage:**
1.  **Set the directory:** Before running the script, you must modify the `directory` variable within the script to point to the target directory containing the `.pdb` files you want to process.
    ```python
    directory = "/path/to/your/pdb_files"  # Change this to your directory
    ```
2.  **Run the script:** Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python pdb-split-files.py
    ```
    The script will process all `.pdb` files in the specified directory. The output PDB files, each containing a 9-residue subsequence, will be saved in the same directory.

**Dependencies:**
*   **BioPython:** This script requires the BioPython library to parse and manipulate PDB files. You can install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install biopython
    ```

**Warning:** This script can generate a large number of output files, especially when processing PDB files with many residues or a large number of PDB files in the input directory. It is strongly recommended to test this script on a small subset of your data first to understand the potential output volume.
